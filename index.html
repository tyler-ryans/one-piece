        <dt>Rexy</dt>
        <dd>Nobody knows of Rexy in Jurassic World Rebirth for sure but rexy most likely passed away due to disease or age as of dominion she was 35 and rebirth takes place 5 years after dominion and as the lifespan of a trex is 30years it is very possible that rexy is dead</dd>
        <dt> mosasaurus</dt>
        <dd>while there was a photo of a mosasaurus skull in the background the creator steven spielberg has confirmeed that is not the mosasaurus from jurrasic world </dd>
        <dt>D-rex </dt>
      <dd>  Many fans beleive it is a hybrid made for hunting but the d-rex is actually a failed genetic experiment on creating a T-rex and the age is not confirmed but i is estimated t be 40 years old as Ingen began their experiments in 1985</dd>
      <dt>Asset -87</dt>
      <dd>Presumed to be the first ever hybrid but was deemed a failure due to it being highly agressive as of rebirth it is probaly still alive as it was confirmed it's lifespan was about 55 years old it is still on mantahcorp island after events of camp cretaceous season 4</dd>
